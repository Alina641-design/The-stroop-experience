            <h3>The Rich History of Stroopwafels</h3>
            <p>Stroopwafles were invented in the late 18th century in Gouda, Netherlands! A local baker named Gerard Kamphuisen is credited with creating the first stroopwafel from leftover breadcrumbs, which he mixed with syrup &amp; pressed between two iron plates. What started as a creative way to use bakery scraps quickly became a <em>regional delicacy</em>.</p>
            <p>Originally called <em>&quot;syrupwafel&quot;</em> by locals, these treats were initially sold by street vendors who carried special warming stoves. During the 19th century, stroopwafels spread throughout the Netherlands, with each region developing its own <strong>subtle variations</strong>. The industrial revolution brought mechanized production, making stroopwafels more accessible to everyone.</p>
            <h4>The Waffle Cookie Base:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flour</strong> - Provides the structure for the thin, crispy layers</li>
                <li><strong>Butter</strong> - Creates the rich, tender texture &amp; distinctive flavor</li>
                <li><strong>Brown sugar</strong> - Adds sweetness &amp; helps achieve the golden color</li>
                <li><strong>Eggs</strong> - Bind the dough &amp; contribute to the cookie's texture</li>
                <li><strong>Yeast</strong> - A small amount creates slight fermentation for <em>complex flavor</em></li>
                <li><strong>Cinnamon</strong> - The signature spice that gives stroopwafels their warm aroma</li>
            </ul>
             <h4>The Stroop (Caramel Syrup) Filling:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brown sugar or treacle</strong> - Forms the base of the caramel</li>
                <li><strong>Butter</strong> - Adds richness &amp; smooth texture</li>
                <li><strong>Cinnamon</strong> - Complements the cookie layers</li>
                <li><strong>Vanilla</strong> - Provides depth of flavor</li>
            </ul>
             <h3>How to Eat Stroopwafels Like a True Dutch Person</h3>
            <p>There's definitely a <strong>right way &amp; wrong way</strong> to enjoy stroopwafels! The Dutch have perfected the art over centuries, &amp; following their methods will give you the most authentic experience.</p>

            <h4>The Traditional Coffee Cup Method:</h4>
            <p>Place your stroopwafel on top of a <strong>hot cup of coffee or tea</strong> for 2-3 minutes. The steam will gently warm the waffle &amp; soften the caramel filling to the perfect consistency. This is the <em>classic Dutch way</em> &amp; transforms a good stroopwafel into an extraordinary experience.</p>

            <h4>Temperature &amp; Timing:</h4>
            <p>Stroopwafels should be enjoyed <strong>warm, never cold</strong>. When warm, the caramel becomes slightly gooey &amp; the waffle layers become more tender. In the Netherlands, they're traditionally enjoyed with <em>afternoon coffee</em> around 3 PM or as a morning treat.</p>

            <h4>The Proper Bite Technique:</h4>
            <p>Take <em>small, deliberate bites</em> to avoid the caramel filling from squeezing out the sides. Real stroopwafel enthusiasts know that the center bite, with the most filling, should be saved for last! They pair wonderfully with strong Dutch coffee, black tea, or even hot chocolate on cold days.</p>
